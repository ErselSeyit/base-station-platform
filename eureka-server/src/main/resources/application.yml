# ============================================
# EUREKA SERVER CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# Eureka is the service discovery server that maintains a registry
# of all microservices in the system. Services register themselves
# and can discover other services through this registry.
#
# Key concepts:
# - Service Registration: Services announce their availability
# - Service Discovery: Services find other services by name
# - Heartbeats: Regular pings to confirm service health
# - Self-preservation: Protects registry during network partitions
# ============================================
eureka:
  instance:
    # hostname: The hostname used by this Eureka server instance.
    # In standalone mode, use 'localhost'. In clustered mode, use
    # the actual hostname or IP for peer replication.
    hostname: ${EUREKA_INSTANCE_HOSTNAME:localhost}
  client:
    # register-with-eureka: false for standalone server (no peers).
    # Set to true in clustered mode where Eureka servers replicate.
    register-with-eureka: false
    
    # fetch-registry: false for standalone server.
    # Set to true in clustered mode to sync with peer registries.
    fetch-registry: false
    
    # service-url.defaultZone: The URL where this Eureka server
    # is available. Other services use this to register/discover.
    # Format: http://<host>:<port>/eureka/
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/
